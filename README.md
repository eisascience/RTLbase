## The R Transfer Learning (RTL) Classification Framework - Baseline Implementation v1.0.0
### DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.2094074 

-----------

A transductive transfer learning (TL) classification framework, that adapts generalized linear classification hyperplane obtained on training data to the previously unseen testing data to identify distinct classes; specifically, subsets of cells defined by a phenotype or a signature from flow-based and transcriptomic single-cell assays.

This framework was developed as part of a PhD dissertation research, focused on developing robust and reproducible methods to identify rare cellular subsets from high-dimensional single-cell data (e.g., CyTOF or scRNASeq).
