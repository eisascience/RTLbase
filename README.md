Current Development: RTLbase v1.0.0, a sub-package of RTL v1.0.0

A transductive transfer learning (TL) classification framework, that adapts generalized linear classification hyperplane obtained on training data to the previously unseen testing data to identify distinct classes; specifically, subsets of cells defined by a phenotype or a signature from flow-based and transcriptomic single-cell assays.

This framework was developed as part of a PhD dissertation research, focused on developing robust and reproducible methods to identify rare cellular subsets from high-dimensional single-cell data (e.g., CyTOF or scRNASeq).

Based on a workshop manuscript proposed by Lee et al. (2011) for automated classification of flowcytometry data
